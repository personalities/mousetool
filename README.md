This zip file contains this readmezip.txt file and the MouseTool setup file, InstallMouseTool3.exe. To install MouseTool, run the setup file.

What MouseTool Does:

MouseTool clicks the mouse for you. Its basic operation is simple: it watches as you move the mouse, and when you pause, it clicks.

You also have many other options to control MouseTool's behavior:

You can use hotkeys as if they were mouse buttons, or to control MouseTool. Smart Drag mode allows you to drag the mouse cursor without using hotkeys. MouseTool is context-aware; it is constantly watching the window that

is under the mouse, so it can send the right click type (left-, right-, double-, or drag) to any given window.
And more. See the help file for details.

Note: On some systems, the mouse cursor automatically moves over the default button whenever you open a dialog box. If your system doesn't do this then you're fine, but if your system does this, you will have to disable this behavior in order to use MouseTool.

This behavior is not a standard part of Windows; it is provided by third-party mouse software, usually in software provided by a mouse manufacturer. To disable this behavior, you will probably have to go to an icon in the Control Panel (but this depends on the software).

The License: MouseTool is Donationware. What this means is that if you find yourself using it, please send a U.S. $20 donation to any charity of your choice. There are many good charities out there who could use your help -- please give.

MouseTool is protected by the GNU General Public License, however. This means that you are under no legal obligation to pay any money whatsoever to anyone in any form in exchange for being able to use this program. It's yours, it's free, use it. I'd still appreciate it, though, if you would send $20 to a charity if you find yourself using the program. Thanks.

Who I Am: MouseTool was originally written by me, Jeff Roush, to help me deal with my own tendonitis. I had to leave a previous programming job because I became unable to use a mouse and keyboard. Eventually, I developed MouseTool to allow me to use a computer again.

MouseTool was originally part product of necessity, part commercial product, and part labor of love. I use it all the time--I really can't use a computer for any length of time without it.

MouseTool has allowed me to work again. Unfortunately, this means that I don't have the time to support the program any more. But, thanks to all of you who have written over the years ...

MouseTool's home MouseTool and its source code can be downloaded from the MouseTool web site, at www.MouseTool.com. For details about the GNU General public license, see the file gpl.html that should have been installed along with MouseTool. If it was not installed along with MouseTool, then you probably received MouseTool from a third party who is not giving you a full distribution. If this is the case, you can get a full distribution from the MouseTool web site. However, you can also see a copy of the GPL at the GNU site, www.gnu.org.
