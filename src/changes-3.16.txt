MouseTool 3.16 changes
======================

This file details the changes that were made to MouseTool 3.13 to create
MouseTool 3.16. (Don't ask where 3.14 and 3.15 went.)

These changes do not affect the MouseTool licence.

What's new
==========

MouseTool can now detect scroll bars in most windows. If Smart Drag is
enabled in the Global options tab, Smart Drag will be enabled if the
mouse pointer is over a scroll bar *regardless of the current context*.

I find this very useful, as I have smart drag disabled for some windows
and I kept forgetting that sometimes I had to actually press the mouse
button to get the computer to do something... not any more!

This has yet to cause any problems, but if you don't want it you can
disable this behaviour on a per-context basis using the new 'Disable
smart drag in scroll bar' option on the Context options tab. I have
been using this new version for about 2-3 months now, and I have yet
to find a use for this option...

Scroll bars
===========

Internet Explorer windows (including HTML help) don't use the standard
Windows scroll bar facilities, so Mouse Tool can't tell there's a scroll
bar.

MouseTool should detect left-hand scroll bars (as found in right-to-left
languages) and support them correctly. Unfortunately this has yet to be
tested, as I don't have a suitable version of windows or indeed any
suitable software. If anyone has any problems with left-hand scrollbars
and MouseTool, let me know and I'll do my best to fix them.

Bugs Lurking
============

* I've had MouseTool hang a couple of times. This may be down to changes
I've made, but I'm pretty sure it happened before once or twice. This is
very rare.

* Sometimes the task bar icon gets stuck, and doesn't change. MouseTool
continues to operate normally. You can live with this, or restart MouseTool.
This occurs in both 3.13 and 3.16 under Win2000 at least (which is all I
use). One day I'll try and work this out.
